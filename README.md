## Installing

Add the tap as follows:

```bash
$ brew tap DonaldKellett/games
```

Then search for and install formulae as usual.

## Contributing

This repo is not accepting pull requests for adding and/or removing formulae to/from the tap; however, issue reports on existing formulae are welcome. If there is an issue with an existing formula and you know a fix, feel free to open a bugfix pull request after seeking approval from the maintainer, ensuring that the patched formula works (or fails gracefully) on both macOS and Linux.

In case discrepancies in formula behavior exist between Linux distributions, the reference distribution shall be Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
